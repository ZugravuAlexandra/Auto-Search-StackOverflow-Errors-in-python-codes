# Auto-Search-StackOverflow-Errors-in-python-codes

Have you ever found yourself stuck with a coding error in your Python project, endlessly searching Stack Overflow for a solution, only to find yourself drowning in a sea of irrelevant answers?

This Python code offers an automatic solution to your coding problems. It quickly and conveniently opens Stack Overflow files with relevant answers to your error messages. This makes it easy to identify and resolve coding issues with speed and efficiency.

To use it you simply create a Python file called test.py and input your code. Then, import the errorfinder.py and run the code. 

This code will automatically search Stack Overflow for answers to any errors in your code. It will then open relevant Stack Overflow pages in your browser or if no errors are detected, the code will return a message saying "No errors found. YUPPYY! :)" This saves you valuable time and effort, allowing you to focus on developing your project.

Say goodbye to endless searches and hello to a more streamlined coding experience! :)
